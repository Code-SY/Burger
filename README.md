### Burger

Eat-Da-Burger! 
Is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" - button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
